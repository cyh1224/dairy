### First day

In this morning, I read a passage that title <<How programmer study English>>, I think very good about many advises on it.
The first point I got is that read technolygy stuff instead of common stuff(praise reading).
The second point is watch many abroad teach video made by famous programmer(praise listening).
The third is chat with many abroad programmer on stack overflow site,reddit and other platform. 
The fourth is that I determine write a dairy every day from now on(praise writing). 
In the past, I change many different way to study English, but this times I determine walk by this way until success .
Thanks Lord to give me a good wife,Who take care my life and help each other with me in each day. 
She also like to help me to study English. In the End,say I LOVE YOU dear,HUIHUI my most powerful helper.
