### First day

In this morning, I read a passage that title <<How a programmer studies English>>, I think it is very good about many advices.The first point I got is that to read technology stuff instead of common stuff to improve reading.
The second point is that watching many foreign teach video made by famous programmer to practice listening.
The third is that chatting with many programmers aboard on stack overflow site,reddit and other platforms. 
The fourth is that I determine to write a dairy every day from now on to improve writing. 
In the past, I changed many different ways to study English, but this times I determine to follow this way until I am succeed .
Thanks Lord to give me a good wife,Who takes care of my life and help me in each day. 
She also would like to help me to study English. In the End,I would like to say I LOVE YOU dear,HUIHUI my most powerful helper.
